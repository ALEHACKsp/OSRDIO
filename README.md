# OSRDIO
This is a simple KMDF driver that we use as one of the first case studies in our [Writing WDF Drivers seminar](https://www.osr.com/seminars/wdf-drivers/).
The driver supports a subset of the features of the National Instruments [PCIe-6509 Digital I/O Device](https://www.ni.com/en-us/support/model.pcie-6509.html).
Please see the code for more descriptive information and for specific license information.
